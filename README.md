# bindicator-pi

Not my idea- saw someone post this idea on Facebook and thought it would be fun to code myself. 

If set-up correctly, this code makes a Raspberry Pi with an led strip/light attached to it light up a different colour depending on what bin day it is.

For the Wirral:

Green = Non-Recyclable 

Grey = Recyclable

Brown = Garden Waste

# Pi Set-up

For this to work you need:
An RGB LEB-strip (with 3 pins for RGB and 1 pin for 12V DC)

A breadboard

Jumper wires (m-f and m-m)

Three N-channel MOSFETs

Power supply for LEDs

A power jack

PiGPIO software

Ruby!
